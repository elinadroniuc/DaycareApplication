# Kindergarten Enrollment Management System

## Overview
This project is a backend-oriented application designed to automate the kindergarten enrollment process.  
It allows managing enrollment applications, processing admission results, and retrieving enrollment information.

The project was developed as part of my studies to practice backend logic, data modeling, and access control.

## Features
- Management of child enrollment applications
- Storage of child and parent data
- Role-based access control (administrator and operator)
- Search and filtering of records
- Data validation during creation and editing
- File handling for storing photos
- Database backup functionality

## Technologies Used
- C#
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Relational data concepts
- File handling

## Design and Implementation Notes
Due to my limited experience at the time of development, some object-oriented design principles were not applied optimally.  
In particular, certain responsibilities could be better separated, and some classes handle more logic than they ideally should.

Despite this, the project helped me gain valuable experience in:
- Implementing real-world business logic
- Working with access control and roles
- Understanding data relationships and validation
- Writing maintainable backend code

## Possible Improvements
With my current knowledge, I would:
- Improve class responsibilities and apply SOLID principles more consistently
- Refactor the domain model
- Improve overall code structure and readability

## Status
The project is functional and represents an important step in my backend development learning process.
